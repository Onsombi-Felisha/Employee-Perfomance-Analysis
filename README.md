## Project Overview

The project is set to analyse the employee perfomance in INX Future Inc, which is a data analytics and automation solution provider.For the past 5 years, the company is rated among the best 20 employees. However, recently the company has seen the employee performance indexes are not healthy and this is becoming a growing concern among the top management. There has been increased escalations on service delivery and client satisfaction levels came down by 8 percentage points. The CEO decided to initiate a data science project , which aims to analyse the employee perfomance. The following goals and insights are expected from the project :
* Department wise performances
* Top 3 Important Factors affecting employee performance
* A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees
* Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.

## ANALYSIS

The Dataset went through univariate and bivariate analysis to get more understanding on the data. Visualisations through histograms,pie charts and histoplots and coorelation analysis. Analysis per department by perfomance rating to satisfy the second goal.

### BIVARIATE ANALYSIS
### DEPARTMENT WISE PERFORMANCE
Data Science and Development departments have the highest mean perfomance rating of 3 while the rest of the departments have a mean perfomance rating of 2.
In all departments those with a high salary percentage have a high perfomance rating.
Also a high level of environment satisfaction translates to high perfomance rating..

**Sales Department**

The Performace rating level 3 (High) is more in the sales department.

The male employees in the sales departmnent have a performance rating that is little bit higher compared to female.

Divorced have a rating of 3 while the married and single have a less rating.

The total work experience does not count the performance rating.

**Human Resources Department**

Most employees employees have a level 3 performance.

The older people are performing low in this department.

The female employees in HR department doing really well in their performance.

The total work experience does matter to performance in this department.

**Development Department**

 The largest number of employees are level 3 performers.

 Managers have the highest rating of 3

 The gender-based performance is nearly same for both.

**Data Science Department**

The highest average of level 3 performance is in data science department.

Businees Analyst in the department have highest rating

The overall performance is higher compared to all departments.

Male employees are doing good in this department.

**Research & Development Department**

The largest number of employees are level 3 performers.

Managers have the highest rating while Health Care Rep have the lowest rating.

The gender-based performance is nearly same for both.

### COORELATION ANALYSIS

The Total years of experience and job level are having the higher correlation when comparing to all features.

Experience years at this company and years with the current manager has the second higher relation between these features.

Experience years at this company and experience in the current role makes the sense of correlation.

People who have more experience with the company has the more probability to get the promotion from the correlation between them.

In this plot, the age has the important role in the total number of work experience of an employee where it is a universal truth.

### Machine Learning Model

A TRAINED MODEL WHICH CAN PREDICT THE EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE BASED ON FACTORS AS INPUTS

A machine learning model was trained using the data and the following are the accuracy scores:
1.   Random Forest classifier - 91%
2.   Decision Tree Classifier - 87%

Random Forest Classifier had the highest accuracy score(91%) therefore suitable for training and developing the model.

### Conclusions 

#### TOP 3 IMPORTANT FACTORS
One of the goals of this project is to find the important feature affecting the performance rating. The important features were predicted using the machine learning model(Random Forest Classifier) feature importance technique.From it the Machine Learning Model concluded that the following are the important features:
1. Employee Salary Hike Percentage
2. Employee Environment Satisfaction
3. Years Since the last Promotion


### Recommendations to improve employee perfomance

The recommendations are as follows:

1. To increase the employee salary hike percentage, salary hike will boost the employees morale thus increasing perfomance
2. The company needs to focus on the environment satisfaction, give the employees a proper environment that they are comfortable in  and are feeling positive.
3. Promotion will help the employees to achieve more performance by giving the chance to be more responsible and acquire leadership qualities.
4. Employee's work-life balance affects the performance rating. Therefore encourage and train employees on how to achieve proper work life balance to enhance employeeâ€™s perfomance in the company
